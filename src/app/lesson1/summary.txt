React Three Fiber - Day 1 Summary
### Setup & Introduction
Created a React Three Fiber project using Next.js with TypeScript
Installed necessary packages: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, and TypeScript types
Set up client-side rendering using a ClientOnly wrapper component

### Basic Concepts
Reviewed Three.js fundamentals (Scene, Camera, Renderer, Meshes, Materials)
Learned about the declarative approach of React Three Fiber vs. imperative Three.js
Created a simple interactive 3D scene with a rotating cube

### Key Components
Canvas: The container for 3D content
mesh: Basic 3D object component
Geometry components: boxGeometry, etc.
Material components: meshStandardMaterial, meshPhongMaterial

### Lighting
## Added different types of lights to understand their roles:
ambientLight: General scene illumination
directionalLight: Sun-like directional lighting with shadows
spotLight: Focused cone of light for highlights

### Scene Enhancement
Added a floor plane to better visualize lighting and shadows
Implemented a Grid helper for spatial reference
Set custom camera positioning and background color
Set up shadow casting and receiving

### Interactivity
##Used React hooks with R3F:
useRef to reference and manipulate mesh objects
useState for hover and click states
useFrame for animations

### Implemented basic pointer events (onClick, onPointerOver, onPointerOut)

### Next Steps
#Moving forward with the React Three Fiber roadmap
#Exploring more complex geometries, materials, and interactions
